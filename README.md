# Study Exercices' App

This project was developed under the pretext of studying the react native framework. It was created from the Udemy's react native course and is intended only to test key navigation and communication features between components and to store the notes produced during the course. To facilitate my learning, the notes were made in Brazilian Portuguese, and will not be translated to english.

This project was only tested in an Android emulator due to lack of access to a MAC machine.

## Getting started

### Install the Android Emulator


## Run this project

To run, you need first run the Android emulator on your machine, and then run this rect-native project.

**NOTE:** this project was tested using the **Nexus_5X_API_29_x86** emulator.

### Start this project
